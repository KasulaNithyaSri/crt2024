write a program to find biggest of three numbers using the "if-else-if"

#include <stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
int main() {
  int a,b,c;
  scanf("%d %d %d",&a,&b,&c);
  if(a>b && a>c){
      printf("%d is biggest number",a);
  }
  else
  if(b>c){
      printf("%d is biggest number",b);
  }
  else{
      printf("%d is biggest number",c);
  }
   return 0;
}

Output1:
10 15 2
15 is biggest number

output 2:
15 9 3

output 3:

0 2 4
