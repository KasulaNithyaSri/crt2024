Sample Output 0

program
Sample Input 1

Th%is is m67$y pro***gram
Sample Output 1

This is my program

SOURCE CODE:

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {

    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */    
    char a[50],b[50];
    scanf("%[^\n]s",a);
    int j=0;
    for(int i=0;a[i]!='\0';i++){
        if((a[i]>=65 && a[i]<=90)||(a[i]>=97 && a[i]<=122) || a[i]==32 ){
            
           
            b[j]=a[i];
            j++;
            
        }
        else{
            continue;
        }
    }
    b[j]='\0';
    printf("%s",b);
    return 0;
}
