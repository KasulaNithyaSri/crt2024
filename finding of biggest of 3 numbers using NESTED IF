write a program to find the biggest of 3 numbers using the "NESTED IF" condition

SOURCE CODE:

#include <stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
int main() {
  int a,b,c;
  scanf("%d %d %d",&a,&b,&c);
  if(a>b){
      if(a>c){
          printf("%d is biggest number",a);
      }
      else{
      printf("%d is biggest number",c);
      }
      
  }
  else
  if(b>c){
      printf("%d is biggest number",b);
  }
  else{
      printf("%d is biggest number",c);
  }
  
   return 0;
}


OUTPUT:

13 10 12
13 is biggest number
