#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n,d,s1=0,s2=0;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    while(n>0){
        d=n%10;
        n=n/10;
        if(d%2==0){
            s1=s1+d;
        }
        else{
            s2=s2+d;
        }
    }
      printf("%d is sum of odd numbers in a number\n",s2);
      printf("%d is sum of even numbers in a number",s1);
    return 0;
}

outpit:

125846
6 is sum of odd numbers in a number
